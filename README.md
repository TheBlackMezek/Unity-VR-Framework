# Unity-VR-Framework
A set of scripts and prefab intended as a more developer-friendly alternative to SteamVR and VRTK.

This project aims to create an easy-to-use set of scripts and prefabs to quickly set up basic VR functionality such as teleporting, picking up objects, using doors and buttons, and firing bows.

This project is currently being set up to work with OpenVR and the Vive because that is all I have to test with, but should the option become availabe I would like to expand this to work with other headsets and standards.
